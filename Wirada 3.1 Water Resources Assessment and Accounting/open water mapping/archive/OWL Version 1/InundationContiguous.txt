
Contiguous inundation is mapped by-time-series. A cell is classified as being inundated for a contiguous period 
if the OWL value is EQ, GT, GE, LT or LE a user-selected 'OWL' threshold for a minimum period of time, as specified 
by a user-selected 'duration' threshold. If for a given cell location the 'OWL' threshold and the 'duration' 
threshold was satisfied at least once during the time-series that cell is said to have had a contiguous inundation event
and is given a value of 1. If not, the cell is given a value of 0.
