
Inundation By-Proportion is mapped by-time-series. A cell is classified as being inundated if the OWL 
value is EQ, GT, GE, LT or LE a user-selected 'OWL' threshold and is EQ, GT, GE, LT or LE a user-selected 
'proportion threshold'. Where proportion is the percentage of time inundated, that is to say, the percentage of,
inundation count divided by total count (not including cloud dates). If the inundation criteria and the proportion 
criteria is satisfied a cell is given a value of 1. If not, the cell is given a value of 0.
